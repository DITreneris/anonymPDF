# Debugging Session Log: 2025-06-13

This document provides a detailed analysis of the `pytest` run from `08_fail.txt` and outlines a strategic plan to resolve the remaining 36 test failures.

## 1. High-Level Summary

-   **Tests Collected:** 354
-   **Passed:** 318
-   **Failed:** 36
-   **Primary Root Causes:** The failures are overwhelmingly due to API drift after major refactoring. Key areas of change include the performance optimization subsystem, PII detection return structures, and various method renames across the application. There are very few genuine application logic bugs; most issues are outdated tests.

## 2. Failure Analysis & Debugging Plan

Failures have been grouped by their underlying root cause. The plan prioritizes fixing widespread issues first to rapidly increase the passing test count.

### Group 1: Massive Refactoring of `PerformanceOptimizedProcessor`

This is the largest group of failures, all stemming from a single, heavily refactored class.

-   **Files Affected:** `tests/test_performance_enhanced.py`
-   **Test Nodes:**
    -   `test_processor_initialization`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute 'parallel_processor'`
    -   `test_optimized_processing_session`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute 'create_session'`
    -   `test_parallel_file_processing`: `AssertionError: Expected 'map' to have been called once. Called 0 times.`
    -   `test_single_file_processing_with_caching`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute 'cache'`
    -   `test_get_performance_report`: `TypeError: 'dict' object does not support the context manager protocol`
    -   `test_end_to_end_parallel_processing`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute '_process_single_file_task'`
    -   `test_concurrent_metric_collection`: `KeyError: 'total_files_processed'`
    -   `test_performance_under_load`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute '_process_single_file_task'`
    -   `PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute 'process_files'`

-   **Suspected Root Cause:**
    The `PerformanceOptimizedProcessor` class, likely defined in `app/core/performance.py`, has been completely overhauled. Its public API (e.g., attributes like `parallel_processor`, `cache`, and methods like `create_session`, `process_files`) has changed, breaking all corresponding tests.
-   **Debugging Plan:**
    1.  **Inspect:** Open `app/core/performance.py` and map out the new class structure, properties, and methods of `PerformanceOptimizedProcessor`.
    2.  **Rewrite (Deeper Fix):** Systematically rewrite the tests in `tests/test_performance_enhanced.py` to align with the new, correct API. This is not a quick fix but is essential. Treat the existing test names as a guide to the required functionality that needs testing on the new implementation.

---

### Group 2: PII Detection Return Structure Change

Multiple tests are failing because the data structure returned by the core PII detection function has changed.

-   **Files Affected:** `tests/test_morning_ses5_improvements.py`, `tests/test_pdf_processor.py`
-   **Test Nodes:**
    -   `test_comprehensive_lithuanian_document_processing`: `KeyError: 'names'`
    -   `test_anti_overredaction_in_technical_context`: `KeyError: 'names'`
    -   `test_find_personal_info`: `AssertionError: assert ('names' in {})`
    -   `test_generate_redaction_report`: `AssertionError: assert 'NAMES' in {}`

-   **Suspected Root Cause:**
    The `find_personal_info` method in `app/services/pdf_processor.py` no longer returns a dictionary with a `'names'` key. It appears the entire data structure for found PII has been modified, likely to be a list of data objects or a differently keyed dictionary.
-   **Debugging Plan:**
    1.  **Inspect (Quick Win):** Read the `find_personal_info` method in `app/services/pdf_processor.py` to determine its new return type and structure.
    2.  **Refactor Tests:** Update the assertions in both `test_morning_ses5_improvements.py` and `test_pdf_processor.py` to match the new data structure.

---

### Group 3: Outdated Method Calls & Patches

These failures are due to tests calling or patching methods that have been renamed or removed.

-   **Files Affected:** `tests/test_feedback_system.py`, `tests/adaptive/test_online_learner.py`
-   **Test Nodes:**
    -   `test_feedback_submission_and_processing_flow`: `AttributeError: ... no attribute 'save_training_examples'`
    -   `test_process_pending_feedback`: `AssertionError: Expected 'collect_all_training_data' to have been called once.`
    -   `test_retrain_model_saves_examples_and_triggers_retraining`: `AttributeError: 'OnlineLearner' object has no attribute 'retrain_model'`
    -   `test_retrain_model_saves_examples_but_skips_retraining`: `AttributeError: 'OnlineLearner' object has no attribute 'retrain_model'`

-   **Suspected Root Cause:**
    -   In `test_feedback_system.py`, the test is trying to patch `save_training_examples` on `TrainingDataCollector`, but that method no longer exists. Similarly, a mock for `collect_all_training_data` is asserted but the method being called in the application is likely different now.
    -   In `test_online_learner.py`, the `retrain_model` method has been renamed or removed from the `OnlineLearner` class.
-   **Debugging Plan (Quick Wins):**
    1.  **Find New Method Names:**
        -   Inspect `app/core/training_data.py` to find the correct replacement for `save_training_examples`.
        -   Inspect `app/core/adaptive/online_learner.py` to find the replacement for `retrain_model`.
    2.  **Update Tests:** Correct the method names in the test files (`.py`) for both the direct calls and the `patch` targets.

### Group 4: Data Structure and API Mismatches

This group contains failures where tests expect old dictionary keys or report structures.

-   **Files Affected:** `tests/test_intelligent_cache.py`, `tests/test_analytics_engine.py`, `tests/adaptive/test_ab_testing.py`
-   **Test Nodes:**
    -   `test_comprehensive_stats`: `AssertionError: assert 'general' in {...}`
    -   `test_thread_safety`: `KeyError: 'general'`
    -   `test_generate_report_with_insights`: `AssertionError: assert "summary" in report`
    -   `test_record_and_evaluate_metrics_variant_wins`: `KeyError: 'winner'`

-   **Suspected Root Cause:**
    -   **Cache:** The `get_stats()` method in `IntelligentCache` has changed its output dictionary structure. The `'general'` key seems to have been replaced or nested.
    -   **Analytics:** The `generate_report` method in `QualityInsightsGenerator` no longer includes a `'summary'` key at the top level of its report.
    -   **A/B Testing:** The evaluation result from `ABTestManager` no longer contains a `'winner'` key in the `metrics_comparison` dictionary.
-   **Debugging Plan (Quick Wins):**
    1.  **Inspect Return Values:** For each failure, inspect the relevant application method (`get_stats`, `generate_report`, etc.) to understand its current return structure.
    2.  **Update Assertions:** Modify the test assertions to look for the correct keys and structure.

---

### Group 5: Logger and Serialization Errors

These are specific `TypeError` bugs related to library usage.

-   **Files Affected:** `tests/test_pdf_processor.py`, `tests/test_real_time_monitor.py`
-   **Test Nodes:**
    -   `test_process_pdf_failure_on_invalid_content`: `TypeError: Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument 'error'`
    -   `test_alert_callback_system`: `TypeError: Object of type Mock is not JSON serializable`

-   **Suspected Root Cause:**
    -   A call to a standard Python logger is being made with a custom `error=` keyword argument, which is not supported. This happens deep inside `text_extraction.py`.
    -   A test in `test_real_time_monitor.py` is passing a `Mock` object into a function that eventually tries to serialize it to JSON, which fails.
-   **Debugging Plan (Quick Wins):**
    1.  **Fix Logger Call:** Find the `extraction_logger.warning` call in `app/core/text_extraction.py` (line 86) and reformat it to pass the exception correctly, likely via the `exc_info=True` argument.
    2.  **Fix JSON Serialization:** In `test_alert_callback_system`, replace the `mock_anomaly` object with a real `Anomaly` object or a `MagicMock` configured to be JSON serializable.

### Group 6: Miscellaneous Logic and Test Setup Flaws

This is a "long tail" of varied, independent issues.

-   **Files Affected:** Various
-   **Test Nodes & Causes:**
    -   `test_config_manager.py::test_configuration_validation`: Test fails because it doesn't load a config file, so validation correctly fails. The *test* is wrong, not the code.
    -   `test_training_data_collector.py::test_save_and_load_training_examples`: `TypeError: create_dummy_example() got an unexpected keyword argument 'source'`. The test helper function's signature has changed.
    -   `test_validation_utils.py::test_length_validation`: `AssertionError: assert not True`. The validation function is allowing a name that the test expects to be rejected. This could be a flaw in the validation logic or an incorrect test assumption.
    -   `system/test_adaptive_workflow.py::test_ab_testing_full_lifecycle`: `AttributeError: 'QualityAnalyzer' object has no attribute 'log_ab_test_result'`. Another API mismatch.

-   **Debugging Plan (Fix one-by-one):**
    1.  **Fix Config Test:** Modify `test_configuration_validation` to load `settings.yaml` so it can test the validation logic on a real configuration.
    2.  **Fix Test Helper:** Update the call to `create_dummy_example` in `test_training_data_collector.py` to use the correct arguments.
    3.  **Investigate Validation:** Analyze `validate_person_name` in `app/core/validation_utils.py` to see if its logic matches the test's expectation. Adjust one or the other.
    4.  **Fix System Test:** Find the correct method on `QualityAnalyzer` for logging A/B test results and update the system test.
    5.  **Address Remaining:** Tackle the final few `AssertionError` and `AttributeError` failures by inspecting the relevant application code and updating the tests to match.

By following this plan, starting with the widespread issues in Group 1 and 2, we can efficiently restore the test suite to a healthy state.
