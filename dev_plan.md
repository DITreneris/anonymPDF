# AnonymPDF Development Plan

## Project Overview
AnonymPDF is a web-based SaaS tool for automatically anonymizing PDF documents, specifically designed for insurance companies. The tool removes personal information (names, personal codes, contacts, etc.) before sending documents to DI analysis platforms.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React.js + TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + Uvicorn
- PDF Processing: PyMuPDF (fitz) + pdfminer.six (for text extraction) + spaCy (NER)
- Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- Authentication: OAuth2/OpenID Connect (Keycloak)
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (Docker Compose for development)

## Implementation Status

### Core Backend (Completed ✓ - with recent enhancements)
- [x] FastAPI application setup
- [x] SQLite database integration
- [x] PDF upload and processing endpoints
- [x] File storage handling
- [x] Error handling middleware
- [x] Database models and schemas
- [x] PDF processing service
- [x] NER integration with spaCy (Multi-language: en, lt)
- [x] Language detection
- [x] Redaction patterns and logic (Enhanced with PyMuPDF, multi-language NLP, and refined regex for specific PII including Lithuanian personal codes, VAT codes, dates, addresses, and phone numbers)
- [x] Redaction report generation (Switched to structured JSON report for frontend)

### Frontend (Completed ✓ - with recent enhancements)
- [x] React application with TypeScript
- [x] Material-UI components
- [x] Drag-and-drop file upload
- [x] Document list with status
- [x] Download functionality (Verified and URL construction improved)
- [x] Error handling and loading states (Enhanced report display with structure parsing, skeleton loaders)
- [x] Responsive design

### Testing (Completed ✓ - with updates)
- [x] PDF processor unit tests (Core logic tested)
- [x] Language detection tests
- [x] Async upload tests
- [x] Redaction functionality tests (Obsolete tests removed; Iterative E2E testing by user informed PII pattern refinements)
- [x] Test fixtures and mocks

### Documentation (Completed ✓ - with updates)
- [x] API documentation (FastAPI auto-docs)
- [x] Endpoint documentation (via auto-docs)
- [x] Request/response examples (via auto-docs)
- [x] Error handling documentation (Improved with structured error responses)
- [x] Status codes and notes
- [x] README.md updated with detailed setup, tech stack, and project structure.
- [x] morning_ses1.md updated with task completion.

## Performance Metrics
- Upload time: ≤3s for PDFs up to 10MB
- Anonymization time: ~5-10s for PDFs up to 10MB (Actual redaction with PyMuPDF)
- Concurrent users: Up to 5 users (MVP)
- Uptime target: ≥99.5%

## Security Features
- [x] Input validation
- [x] File type verification
- [x] Secure file storage (Processed files stored, temporary files cleaned up)
- [x] Error message sanitization (Structured errors, not leaking raw exceptions to client where possible)
- [x] Temporary file cleanup

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement user authentication
2. [ ] Add audit logging
3. [ ] Set up monitoring
4. [ ] Implement backup system
5. [ ] Add batch processing capability

## Dependencies
(Key backend dependencies from requirements.txt)
```python
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
python-multipart==0.0.6
pdfminer.six==20221105
spacy==3.7.2
# lt_core_news_sm (spaCy model, installed via spacy download)
# en_core_web_sm (spaCy model, installed via spacy download)

## Current Status
- Core functionality significantly enhanced with real redaction and improved PII detection.
- Frontend application reflects these changes with structured report display.
- Backend services are operational with new capabilities.
- Testing suite adapted (some tests removed/modified, user E2E testing drove improvements).
- Documentation (README, morning_ses1.md) updated to reflect progress.

## Future Enhancements
1. User Management
   - User roles and permissions
   - User activity tracking
   - Session management

2. Advanced Features
   - Batch processing
   - User-configurable custom redaction rules
   - Template management for common document types
   - Export options for redaction reports (CSV, etc.)

3. Infrastructure
   - Containerization (Docker)
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Advanced Monitoring and logging (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Backup and recovery strategies for DB and processed files.

4. Security
   - Robust Authentication system (e.g., Keycloak integration)
   - Comprehensive Audit logging
   - Data encryption at rest (if required beyond filesystem)
   - Fine-grained Access control

## Notes
- Real PDF redaction is now implemented.
- PII detection has been iteratively improved based on testing and feedback.
- The application is more robust but still requires thorough testing for production.
- Next phase should focus on security (authentication) and operational aspects (monitoring, logging, CI/CD).

## Ambition Update (2024-05-23) - Achieved & Enhanced

- **Goal:** Move beyond MVP placeholder logic and implement actual PDF redaction/anonymization.
- **We will:**
  - [x] Replace the current logic that only copies PDF pages with real redaction of sensitive information (names, emails, SSNs, etc.). (Done using PyMuPDF and enhanced detection)
  - [x] Use or integrate a library or service that can remove or mask text in-place in PDF files. (Done - PyMuPDF)
  - [x] Ensure the anonymized PDF is truly different from the original and safe for sharing. (Done - Redaction applied, PII detection improved)
  - [x] Maintain a user-friendly frontend and robust backend for real-world use. (Done - Frontend updated, backend logic enhanced)
- **No more butaforic/demo-only anonymization!** (Achieved!)
