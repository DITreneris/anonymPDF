# Project Phoenix: AnonymPDF Integration & Enhancement Plan

This document outlines a phased approach to rectify the identified architectural disconnects, activate dormant feature sets, and improve the overall performance and reliability of the AnonymPDF application.

The project is divided into six distinct phases, designed to deliver value incrementally and ensure stability at each stage.

---

### Phase 1: Foundational Fixes & Core Integration - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Stabilize the application, fix critical bugs, and establish the primary data flow between the frontend and the core PDF processing service, explicitly including the ML engine.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Correct API URL Configuration:** ✅
2.  **Integrate ML Confidence Scoring:** ✅
3.  **Refactor API Error Handling:** ✅
4.  **Implement Asynchronous PDF Processing:** ✅

---

### Phase 2: Activating the Analytics & Adaptive Learning Loop - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Surface the powerful analytics and adaptive learning capabilities to the user by building out the necessary UI components and activating the feedback loop.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Implement User Feedback UI:** ✅
2.  **Enable the Feedback Endpoint:** ✅
3.  **Build the Analytics Dashboard:** ✅
4.  **Implement Automatic API Retries:** ✅

---

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization & Hardening - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Address remaining performance bottlenecks and improve the overall robustness and user experience of the application.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Frontend Performance Review:** ✅
2.  **Complete UI Features:** ✅

---

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Real-Time Insight - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Fully enable the adaptive learning cycle and provide real-time visibility into the application's performance.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Fully Activate Adaptive Learning:** ✅
    *   **Action:** Modified the feedback endpoint and coordinator to retrieve the full document text.
    *   **Action:** Enabled the `process_feedback_and_learn` logic to run pattern discovery.
    *   **Action:** Ensured the `PDFProcessor` loads and uses new adaptive patterns.

2.  **Implement Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** ✅
    *   **Action:** Created a `RealTimeMonitor` service to collect performance data.
    *   **Action:** Integrated the monitor into the `PDFProcessor` to record key events.
    *   **Action:** Exposed the data via a new `/api/monitoring/status` endpoint.
    *   **Action:** Built a `StatusDashboard` on the frontend to display live metrics.

---

### Phase 5: Finalization and Testing - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Increase the stability and reliability of the application by adding targeted tests for the newly implemented, complex features.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Strengthen Backend Testing:** ✅
    *   **Action:** Created an integration test for the real-time monitoring system.
    *   **Action:** Added an end-to-end integration test for the adaptive learning feedback loop.

2.  **Frontend Component Testing:** ✅
    *   **Action:** Set up the frontend testing environment with Jest and React Testing Library.
    *   **Action:** Wrote unit tests for the `StatusDashboard` component to verify all rendering states (loading, error, success).

---

### Phase 6: Deployment & Documentation

**Objective:** Prepare the application for production release and ensure its features and architecture are well-documented for future maintenance and new users.

**Key Tasks:**

-   [ ] **Task 1: Production-Ready Build**
    -   [ ] Create a production build of the frontend (`npm run build`).
    -   [ ] Update the `build-windows.ps1` script to include the new frontend assets and the `monitoring.db`.
    -   [ ] Pin all dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) for reproducible builds.

-   [ ] **Task 2: API & Code Documentation**
    -   [ ] Generate and review the automatic API documentation from FastAPI.
    -   [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to new and modified classes and functions (`RealTimeMonitor`, `AdaptiveLearningCoordinator`, etc.).
    -   [ ] Update the main `README.md` with an overview of the new features and instructions on how to run the new test suites.

-   [ ] **Task 3: User Guide**
    -   [ ] Write a simple guide in `docs/user/` explaining the Feedback System and the Status Dashboard from an end-user's perspective.
