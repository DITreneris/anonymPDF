# Root Cause Analysis Report

**Triage Date:** 2025-06-21  
**Log File:** `58_log.txt`

## Executive Summary

The test suite is experiencing a catastrophic failure event characterized by **16 failed tests** across 3 distinct modules. The failures are not random; they stem from a centralized, high-impact regression in the `DetectionContext` data model and its consumer, `PDFProcessor`. A secondary group of failures points to a similar regression in the `AdvancedPatternRefinement` return data structure.

This is a **Code Red** event, but it is **highly concentrated**. Fixing the `DetectionContext` object and the `PDFProcessor`'s interaction with it will resolve the majority of failures.

### **[CLUSTER 1] Critical Regression: `DetectionContext` Data Model Mismatch**

This is the primary root cause, responsible for **12 direct failures**. A recent change to the `DetectionContext` object has broken its public contract. The object no longer has `start` or `end` attributes, causing `AttributeError` exceptions wherever they are accessed.

-   **Root Cause:** The `DetectionContext` class has been refactored, but its consumers in the application and test code have not been updated.
-   **Impact:** Catastrophic. Every test exercising the core `find_personal_info` or `deduplicate_with_confidence` methods is failing.

#### Evidence Trail:

*   **`AttributeError: 'DetectionContext' object has no attribute 'start'`**
    *   `tests/test_lithuanian_pii.py:66` (and 5 subsequent tests in the same file)
    *   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:100` (and 1 subsequent test in the same file)
    *   `app/services/pdf_processor.py:359` (This is the application code where the error originates)

*   **`AssertionError: assert 'error' == 'processed'`**
    *   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:181`: This assertion fails because the underlying `process_pdf` call throws the `AttributeError` above, causing the result status to be `'error'`.

### **[CLUSTER 2] Data Structure Change: `AdvancedPatternRefinement` Output**

This cluster of **2 failures** indicates that the `find_enhanced_patterns` method in the `AdvancedPatternRefinement` class no longer returns a list of dictionaries containing a `'pattern_name'` key.

-   **Root Cause:** The return value from `AdvancedPatternRefinement` has been changed, likely to a different object or a dictionary with a new schema.
-   **Impact:** High. Breaks specialized tests for high-priority PII patterns.

#### Evidence Trail:

*   **`KeyError: 'pattern_name'`**
    *   `tests/test_priority2_enhancements.py:134`
    *   `tests/test_priority2_enhancements.py:154`

### **[CLUSTER 3] Logic/State Bugs & Incorrect Assertions**

This cluster contains a mix of issues pointing to logic errors or incorrect test assertions, likely unmasked by the above failures. It accounts for **2 direct failures**.

-   **Root Cause:** A combination of incorrect test expectations and potential logic bugs in the application code.
-   **Impact:** Medium. These are specific test bugs, not systemic failures.

#### Evidence Trail:

*   **`KeyError: 'NAMES'`**
    *   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:156`: The redaction report likely uses a different key now (e.g., lowercase `'names'` or a different category enum).
*   **`AssertionError: Expected 'extract_text_from_pdf' to be called once. Called 0 times.`**
    *   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:224`: A logic path in `anonymize_pdf_flow` is now preventing `extract_text_from_pdf` from being called under the test's mocked conditions.

## **Next Step**

Review and approve the `DAY_PLAN.md`. Once approved, I will begin Sprint 1 immediately.
