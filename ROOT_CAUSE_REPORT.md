# Root Cause Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

The test suite is experiencing multiple, systemic failures across PII detection, PDF processing, and adaptive learning modules. The root causes are not isolated bugs but point to deeper architectural issues: inconsistent data models, flawed regular expressions, and broken state management in integration tests. This report details the four primary failure clusters and provides a high-priority action plan.

## 2. Failure Clusters & Deep Diagnostics

### Cluster 1: Flawed Lithuanian PII Detection

-   **Severity:** Critical
-   **Impact:** Core redaction functionality for Lithuanian documents is non-operational. Fails to detect names, locations, and correctly redact phone numbers.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   `tests/test_lithuanian_pii.py:81` in `TestLithuanianIntegration.test_simple_lithuanian_names_detection`
        -   **Log:** `AssertionError: assert 'Linas Vaitkus' in set()`
        -   **Analysis:** The detection logic returns an empty set, indicating a complete failure to identify a basic Lithuanian name.
    -   `tests/test_lithuanian_pii.py:96` in `TestLithuanianIntegration.test_anti_overredaction_in_technical_context`
        -   **Log:** `AssertionError: assert 'Vilniaus' in set()`
        -   **Analysis:** Location detection is failing.
    -   `tests/test_lithuanian_pii.py:113` in `TestLithuanianIntegration.test_anti_overredaction_of_common_words`
        -   **Log:** `AssertionError: assert '+370 699 99999' in ['Jonas Petraitis', '99999']`
        -   **Analysis:** The phone number pattern is incorrect. It only matches and redacts the last part of the number, not the full string.

### Cluster 2: Inconsistent Redaction/Detection Logic

-   **Severity:** High
-   **Impact:** Breaks the main PDF processing flow. The system reports redactions but fails to apply them, and data contracts between components are violated.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:152` in `TestPDFProcessorIntegration.test_process_pdf_success`
        -   **Log:** `AssertionError: assert None == 1` because `{'email': 1}.get('emails')` is `None`.
        -   **Analysis:** A clear data contract violation. The redaction report uses the key `'email'` (lowercase), but the test asset expects `'emails'` (plural). This indicates a lack of schema enforcement.
    -   `tests/test_pdf_processor.py:195` in `TestPDFProcessorIntegration.test_anonymize_pdf_flow`
        -   **Log:** `AssertionError: No redaction annotations found.` (`assert 0 > 0`)
        -   **Analysis:** The system *thinks* it applied redactions (log shows `"redactions_applied": 3`), but no actual `fitz.PDF_ANNOT_SQUARE` annotations were written to the output file. The PII detection result is not being correctly translated into a physical redaction.

### Cluster 3: Broken Advanced Pattern Matching

-   **Severity:** High
-   **Impact:** The `AdvancedPatternRefinement` engine, a key feature, is completely non-functional.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   `tests/test_priority2_enhancements.py:135` in `TestAdvancedPatternRefinement.test_enhanced_email_detection`
        -   **Log:** `assert 0 == 1`
        -   **Analysis:** The refinement engine failed to find a standard email address. This strongly suggests a regression in the `context_analyzer.py` logic or its associated patterns from `patterns.yaml`.
    -   `tests/test_priority2_enhancements.py:144` in `TestAdvancedPatternRefinement.test_enhanced_personal_code_detection`
        -   **Log:** `assert 0 == 1`
        -   **Analysis:** Same as above. The engine is not detecting personal codes as expected.

### Cluster 4: System & Environment Instability

-   **Severity:** Blocker
-   **Impact:** Prevents reliable test runs, especially on developer machines and CI. Causes non-deterministic failures that mask other issues.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   `tests/adaptive/test_pattern_learner.py` shows `FF` (2 failures).
    -   `tests/system/test_real_time_monitor_integration.py` shows `F` (1 failure).
    -   **Analysis:** These failures, combined with knowledge of previous `UnicodeEncodeError` issues on Windows, point to environment-specific problems. The `test_real_time_monitor_integration` failure is particularly concerning as it indicates a breakdown between services, likely due to file handle or encoding issues when writing logs or temporary files on Windows.

## 3. Next Step

With the root causes identified and documented, the immediate next step is to formulate a precise, hour-by-hour coding plan to remediate these issues. We will create `DAY_PLAN.md` to structure our 8-hour session.
