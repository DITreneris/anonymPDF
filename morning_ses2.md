**âœ… Phase 1, 2 & 3 COMPLETED** - All critical foundation, enhanced error handling, and configuration management implemented

### âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 1 - Foundation)
- **M1. Structured Logging Framework** - Comprehensive logging system with file rotation
- **M2. Database Schema Refactoring** - Clean separation of errors vs reports with migration system
- **M3. Dependency Validation System** - Startup validation with clear error messages
- **M4. TypeScript Strict Mode** - Verified and maintained strict compilation

### âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 2 - Enhanced Error Handling)
- **S1. Enhanced Error Handling & User Feedback** - Material-UI error dialogs with recovery suggestions
- **S3. React Error Boundaries & Stability** - Application-wide error boundary with fallback UI

### âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 3 - Configuration & Testing)
- **S2. Configuration Management System** - Externalized PII patterns to config files
- **S4. Comprehensive Test Suite** - 44 passing tests covering all critical functionality
- **Performance Optimization** - Real-time metrics and monitoring system
- **Advanced Testing** - Error path and performance testing implemented

### âœ… PII DETECTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (December 2024)
- **Enhanced Lithuanian PII Detection Patterns:**
  - **VAT Codes**: Improved detection of labeled VAT codes (`PVM kodas: LT100001738313`) and standalone codes
  - **Phone Numbers**: Comprehensive Lithuanian phone number detection (`+370 600 55678`, `Tel. nr.: +370 600 55678`, `+37060055678`)
  - **Addresses**: Enhanced address detection including generic patterns (`Paupio g. 50-136`, `Gedimino pr. 25`)
  - **IBANs**: Lithuanian IBAN detection (`LT123456789012345678`)
  - **Business Certificates**: Detection of business certificate numbers (`AF123456-1`)
  - **Dates**: Support for multiple date formats (`2024-01-15`, `1989.03.15`)
  - **City Names**: Comprehensive Lithuanian city and location detection (60+ cities, districts, neighborhoods)
  - **Postal Codes**: Lithuanian postal code detection (`LT-11341`)
- **City Detection System:**
  - Added comprehensive list of Lithuanian cities, districts, and regions
  - Includes major cities (Vilnius, Kaunas, KlaipÄ—da, etc.) and administrative divisions
  - Smart word-boundary matching to avoid false positives
  - Covers neighborhoods and common location suffixes
- **Pattern Testing**: All patterns tested and verified with real-world Lithuanian examples

### ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE (Phase 4 - Advanced Features & Polish)
- Advanced PII pattern management UI
- Accessibility improvements
- Installation package
- Analytics and monitoring
- Client feedback integration
- Documentation updates

## Key Architectural Decisions & Current State

- **Deployment Model:** Local desktop application installed on client computers
- **Database:** SQLite for local data storage (appropriate for single-user environment)
- **Backend Core:**
  - Built with FastAPI (Python) serving localhost
  - PDF Anonymization: PyMuPDF (fitz) for actual content redaction
  - PII Detection: Combination of spaCy (using `en_core_web_sm` for English and `lt_core_news_sm` for Lithuanian) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and custom Regex patterns for specific PII
  - Reporting: Generates a structured JSON report detailing redactions
- **Frontend Core:**
  - Built with React 19.1 and TypeScript
  - UI Components: Material-UI v7.1.0
  - Report Display: Parses the JSON report for structured display
  - File Handling: Supports PDF upload and download
