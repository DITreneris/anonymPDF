### üéØ Session Goals

This session is dedicated to planning the next phase of our MLOps maturity. The objective is to move from a functional, integrated ML system to a robust, automated, and observable one. We will investigate and design solutions for three key strategic areas identified in the previous analysis, creating a clear roadmap for implementation.

1.  **"Close the Loop":** Architect a fully automated model retraining, validation, and deployment pipeline.
2.  **Enhance Observability:** Design a comprehensive monitoring solution for real-time visibility into model performance, data drift, and system health.
3.  **Implement Advanced Feature Management:** Establish a formal process for analyzing, managing, and optimizing the feature set as the system evolves.

## üìã Implementation Plan

### Part 1: Automated Retraining Pipeline Investigation (75 minutes)

**Objective:** Define the architecture and workflow for a robust, automated model retraining, validation, and safe deployment pipeline. This will ensure the system continuously learns from user feedback without manual intervention.
**Status:** ‚è≥ Planned

**Tasks:**
1.  **Define Retraining Triggers:**
    -   **Task 1.1: Threshold-Based Trigger:** Document the logic for initiating retraining after a specific number of new `TrainingExample` records are collected via the feedback loop. Propose an initial threshold (e.g., 500 new examples).
    -   **Task 1.2: Performance Degradation Trigger:** Design a mechanism where the `QualityAnalyzer` can flag a significant drop in a key metric (e.g., precision drops by 10% over a 24-hour period), triggering a retraining event.
    -   **Task 1.3: Scheduled Trigger:** Plan for a regular, scheduled retraining job (e.g., weekly) to capture gradual concept drift.

2.  **Architect the Retraining Workflow:**
    -   **Task 2.1: Design `MLRetrainingManager`:** Outline a new class or module (`app/core/ml_retraining_manager.py`) responsible for orchestrating the entire pipeline.
    -   **Task 2.2: Define Workflow Steps:** Detail the sequence of operations:
        1.  Fetch new data from `TrainingDataStorage`.
        2.  Invoke `MLConfidenceScorer.train_model()` to create a "challenger" model.
        3.  Perform automated validation against a hold-out test set.
        4.  Log all results, metrics, and model artifacts using `MLModelManager`.

3.  **Design the Validation & Promotion Strategy:**
    -   **Task 3.1: Define "Challenger vs. Control" Criteria:** Establish a clear, multi-faceted validation gate. A challenger model must be, for example, >2% better on AUC, have a prediction latency within 10% of the control, and show no major feature bias shifts.
    -   **Task 3.2: Plan Safe Canary Deployment:** Document the process for promoting a validated challenger. It should be initially deployed as a variant in the `ABTestManager` to a small fraction of traffic (e.g., 10%).
    -   **Task 3.3: Automate Model Promotion:** Design the final step where a successful canary model is promoted to the new "control" model, with the `MLModelManager` updating the "latest" version pointer.

4.  **Evaluate Technology Stack:**
    -   **Task 4.1: Internal Scheduler:** Analyze the feasibility of using a lightweight, in-process scheduler like `APScheduler` for managing the triggers.
    -   **Task 4.2: External Orchestrator:** For future scalability, perform a high-level comparison of tools like Prefect or Dagster, noting their benefits for complex dependency management and observability.

### Part 2: Enhanced Observability & Monitoring Investigation (60 minutes)

**Objective:** Design a solution for real-time monitoring of ML model performance, data drift, and system health to enable proactive issue detection and resolution.
**Status:** ‚è≥ Planned

**Tasks:**
1.  **Identify Key Monitoring Metrics:**
    -   **Task 1.1: Model Performance:** List core metrics from `QualityAnalyzer` (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, AUC per PII category).
    -   **Task 1.2: System Health:** List metrics from `MLConfidenceScorer` (e.g., average prediction latency, error rate) and `MLModelManager` (e.g., model age, number of loaded models).
    -   **Task 1.3: Data & Concept Drift:** Plan metrics to track changes in feature distributions (e.g., mean, median, std dev of key features) and prediction confidence scores over time.

2.  **Architect the Monitoring Data Pipeline:**
    -   **Task 2.1: Design `MonitoringConnector`:** Outline a new class (`app/core/monitoring_connector.py`) that acts as an abstraction layer for sending metrics to an external system. It should have a simple interface (e.g., `log_metric(name, value, tags)`).
    -   **Task 2.2: Plan Integration Points:** Identify where to call the `MonitoringConnector` within the existing codebase (e.g., in `MLConfidenceScorer` after prediction, in `QualityAnalyzer` after evaluation).

3.  **Evaluate Monitoring Platforms:**
    -   **Task 3.1: Open-Source Stack:** Research the pros and cons of a Prometheus + Grafana stack. Focus on deployment complexity and query flexibility.
    -   **Task 3.2: ML-Specific Platforms:** Research the pros and cons of managed services like Weights & Biases or MLflow Tracking. Focus on ease of integration and built-in ML visualization capabilities.
    -   **Task 3.3: Make a Recommendation:** Based on the analysis, provide a recommendation with a clear justification.

4.  **Design a Sample Dashboard:**
    -   **Task 4.1: Sketch Dashboard Layout:** Create a text-based or markdown sketch of a primary monitoring dashboard (e.g., "ML System Health"), detailing which widgets would be present (e.g., "Confidence Score Distribution," "Prediction Latency (p95)").

### Part 3: Advanced Feature Management Investigation (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Establish a strategy for managing the growing feature set to ensure model performance, reduce redundancy, and improve maintainability.
**Status:** ‚è≥ Planned

**Tasks:**
1.  **Establish Feature Importance & Selection Process:**
    -   **Task 1.1: Plan for Automated Analysis:** Design a script, to be run after each retraining, that uses SHAP or permutation importance to calculate and save the importance scores for every feature in the new model.
    -   **Task 1.2: Define a Feature Review Cadence:** Propose a quarterly review process where the engineering team analyzes the feature importance report to identify trends and document key drivers of model performance.
    -   **Task 1.3: Develop a Feature Pruning Strategy:** Establish data-driven criteria for identifying low-impact or redundant features (e.g., importance score < 0.001%, high correlation with another feature).

2.  **High-Level Evaluation of a Feature Store:**
    -   **Task 2.1: Research Core Concepts:** Document the primary benefits of a feature store (e.g., consistency between training/serving, reusability, discovery).
    -   **Task 2.2: Assess Current Need:** Analyze whether the project's current complexity justifies the overhead of integrating a feature store like Feast.
    -   **Task 2.3: Document Future Vision:** Create a high-level diagram showing how a feature store would integrate into the existing architecture, replacing parts of the current `FeatureExtractor` and `TrainingDataStorage`.
